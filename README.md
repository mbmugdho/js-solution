JavaScript Problem-Solving Task
Solve the following JavaScript problems using basic syntax (no frameworks or advanced libraries). You may use functions, loops, conditionals, array methods, or string methods where necessary.

Rules and Regulations
Solve all 10 problems.
Pick any 5 problems and explain your solutions in a 5-minute video with screen recording and voice-over.
Use only plain JavaScript.
Do your own logic to solve the problems - copying or AI-generated answers will lead to disqualification.
We care more about your logic and explanation than perfect code.
Create a public GitHub repository and upload your code there.

Problem 1: Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

Example:

Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"

Problem 2: Count Vowels in a String
Write a function that counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in a given string.

Example:

Input: "programming"
Output: 3

Problem 3: Check for Palindrome
Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

Example:

Input: "madam"
Output: true
Input: "hello"
Output: false

Problem 4: Find the Maximum Number
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.

Example:

Input: [5, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 9

Problem 5: Remove Duplicates from an Array
Write a function that removes all duplicate numbers from an array.

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Problem 6: Sum of All Numbers in an Array
Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers in an array.

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 10

Problem 7: Find Even Numbers in an Array
Write a function that returns all even numbers from a given array.

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [2, 4, 6]

Problem 8: Capitalize First Letter of Each Word
Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.

Example:

Input: "hello world"
Output: "Hello World"

Problem 9: Find the Factorial of a Number
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

Example:

Input: 5
Output: 120

Problem 10: PingPong Challenge
Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 20.

Example:

For multiples of 3, print "Ping"
For multiples of 5, print "Pong"
For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "PingPong"
If the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, print the number itself
Example Output:

1, 2, Ping, 4, Pong, Ping, 7, 8, Ping, Pong, 11, Ping, 13, 14, PingPong, 16 …..
